To prune a model,

1) take your trained model

2) put pruning wrappers on the layers

3) "fine tune" by training for a few more epochs

4) remove pruning wrapper if you want to use with hls. 


example is in the "pruning_example.py"


See "The lottery ticket hypothesis" to improve this technique. I never tried it. You could also try pruning to higher sparsities.

Here is a paper about it:
