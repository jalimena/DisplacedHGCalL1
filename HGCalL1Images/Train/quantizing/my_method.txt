steps for quantizing:

Wrappers:
1) Take trained model
2) apply quantize wrappers
3) train for a few more epochs

Disadvantage of this method is you must leave the wrappers on, and hls does not know what to do with this.
Especially when you quantize the output layer.



QKeras:
1) when you first create the model, use QKeras layers
advantage is hls can handle this, though i ran into a few issues.
